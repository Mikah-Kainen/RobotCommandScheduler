Since ConditionScheduleables return true to finish when their condition is not met, 
WhenAnyGroups will finish as soon as any internal ConditionScheduleable's condition is not met

Scheduleables with no requirements are not guaranteed to be safe if they take more than one cycle
to run. This is because two no requirement scheduleables could run in parallel (As in don't schedule
them with initialization or cleanup scheduleables)

LoopGroups Initialize every time they re-loop. This is actually something I might change. Like, if you want to initialize
do it in functions you schedule. The Loop initialize should be for resetting an important variable or something...
