Rename LoopGroup to LoopWrapper
Rename CommandBuilder to ScheduleableBuilder
Rename CreateCommand to CreateScheduleable

//Sidenote, add ApplyParameters function to CommandBuilder, that returns a ScheduleableWrapper that has its own CreateCommand,
//SetInitialization, SetCleanup, and also eventually AddEndCheck

//Ok another sidenote: LoopGroup which will be LoopWrapper should totally have some function that runs every loop. This could
//make it way more flexible. Think for loop
